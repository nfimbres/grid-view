## Overview

Low-vision (LV) students face significant challenges when learning indentation-based programming languages like Python due to difficulty perceiving and navigating structured code.  
This Visual Studio Code extension introduces a dual-view layout that displays both standard text and a structured grid to enhance clarity, reduce errors, and promote better understanding of code structure.

The grid view visually represents indentation levels with real-time updates and high-contrast color-coded indicators, providing an accessible, supportive learning environment.

---

## Features

- Dual-View: Standard text editor alongside a structured, grid-based view.
- High-Contrast Visualization: Color-coded indentation levels for improved visibility.
- Real-Time Synchronization: Instant updates between code and grid views.
- Configurable Settings: Customize colors and feedback options.
- Modular Architecture: Built for future expansion and updates.
